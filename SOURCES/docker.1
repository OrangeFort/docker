.SH NAME
.PP
docker \- Docker image and container command line interface

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBdocker\fP [OPTIONS] COMMAND [arg...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBdocker\fP has two distinct functions. It is used for starting the Docker
daemon and to run the CLI (i.e., to command the daemon to manage images,
containers etc.) So \fBdocker\fP is both a server, as a daemon, and a client
to the daemon, through the CLI.

.PP
To run the Docker daemon you do not specify any of the commands listed below but
must specify the \fB\-d\fP option.  The other options listed below are for the
daemon only.

.PP
The Docker CLI has over 30 commands. The commands are listed below and each has
its own man page which explain usage and arguments.

.PP
To see the man page for a command run \fBman docker \fP.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-D\fP=\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP
   Enable debug mode. Default is false.

.PP
\fB\-H\fP, \fB\-\-host\fP=[unix:///var/run/docker.sock]: tcp://[host:port] to bind or
unix://[/path/to/socket] to use.
   The socket(s) to bind to in daemon mode specified using one or more
   tcp://host:port, unix:///path/to/socket, fd://* or fd://socketfd.

.PP
\fB\-\-api\-enable\-cors\fP=\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP
  Enable CORS headers in the remote API. Default is false.

.PP
\fB\-b\fP=""
  Attach containers to a pre\-existing network bridge; use 'none' to disable container networking

.PP
\fB\-\-bip\fP=""
  Use the provided CIDR notation address for the dynamically created bridge (docker0); Mutually exclusive of \-b

.PP
\fB\-d\fP=\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP

.SH STORAGE DRIVER OPTIONS
.PP
Options to storage backend can be specified with \fB\-\-storage\-opt\fP flags. The
only backend which currently takes options is \fIdevicemapper\fP. Therefore use these
flags with \fB\-s=\fPdevicemapper.

.PP
Here is the list of \fIdevicemapper\fP options:
.SS dm.basesize
.PP
Specifies the size to use when creating the base device, which limits the size
of images and containers. The default value is 10G. Note, thin devices are
inherently "sparse", so a 10G device which is mostly empty doesn't use 10 GB
of space on the pool. However, the filesystem will use more space for the empty
case the larger the device is. \fBWarning\fP: This value affects the system\-wide
"base" empty filesystem that may already be initialized and inherited by pulled
images.
.SS dm.loopdatasize
.PP
Specifies the size to use when creating the loopback file for the "data"
device which is used for the thin pool. The default size is 100G. Note that the
file is sparse, so it will not initially take up this much space.
.SS dm.loopmetadatasize
.PP
Specifies the size to use when creating the loopback file for the "metadadata"
device which is used for the thin pool. The default size is 2G. Note that the
file is sparse, so it will not initially take up this much space.
.SS dm.fs
.PP
Specifies the filesystem type to use for the base device. The supported
options are "ext4" and "xfs". The default is "ext4"
.SS dm.mkfsarg
.PP
Specifies extra mkfs arguments to be used when creating the base device.
.SS dm.mountopt
.PP
Specifies extra mount options used when mounting the thin devices.
.SS dm.datadev
.PP
Specifies a custom blockdevice to use for data for the thin pool.

.PP
If using a block device for device mapper storage, ideally both datadev and
metadatadev should be specified to completely avoid using the loopback device.
.SS dm.metadatadev
.PP
Specifies a custom blockdevice to use for metadata for the thin pool.

.PP
For best performance the metadata should be on a different spindle than the
data, or even better on an SSD.

.PP
If setting up a new metadata pool it is required to be valid. This can be
achieved by zeroing the first 4k to indicate empty metadata, like this:

.PP
.RS

.nf
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/metadata\_dev bs=4096 count=1

.fi
.SS dm.blocksize
.PP
Specifies a custom blocksize to use for the thin pool. The default blocksize
is 64K.
.SS dm.blkdiscard
.PP
Enables or disables the use of blkdiscard when removing devicemapper devices.
This is enabled by default (only) if using loopback devices and is required to
res\-parsify the loopback file on image/container removal.

.PP
Disabling this on loopback can lead to \fImuch\fP faster container removal times,
but will prevent the space used in \fB\fC/var/lib/docker\fR directory from being returned to
the system for other use when containers are removed.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Launching docker daemon with \fIdevicemapper\fP backend with particular block devices
for data and metadata:

.PP
.RS

.nf
docker \-d \-s=devicemapper \\
  \-\-storage\-opt dm.datadev=/dev/vdb \\
  \-\-storage\-opt dm.metadatadev=/dev/vdc \\
  \-\-storage\-opt dm.basesize=20G

.fi
.SS Client
.PP
For specific client examples please see the man page for the specific Docker
command. For example:

.PP
.RS

.nf
man docker run

.fi
