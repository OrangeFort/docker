.SH NAME
.PP
docker\-push \- Push an image or a repository to the registry

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBdocker push\fP
NAME[:TAG]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Push an image or a repository to a registry. The default registry is the Docker
Hub located at 
\[la]https://hub.docker.com/\[ra]. However the
image can be pushed to another, perhaps private, registry as demonstrated in
the example below.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
There are no available options.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SH Pushing a new image to a registry
.PP
First save the new image by finding the container ID (using \fBdocker ps\fP)
and then committing it to a new image name:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# docker commit c16378f943fe rhel\-httpd

.fi

.PP
Now push the image to the registry using the image ID. In this example
the registry is on host named registry\-host and listening on port 5000.
Default Docker commands will push to the default \fB\fChub.docker.com\fR
registry. Instead, push to the local registry, which is on a host called
registry\-host*. To do this, tag the image with the host name or IP
address, and the port of the registry:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# docker tag rhel\-httpd registry\-host:5000/myadmin/rhel\-httpd
# docker push registry\-host:5000/myadmin/rhel\-httpd

.fi

.PP
Check that this worked by running:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# docker images

.fi

.PP
You should see both \fB\fCrhel\-httpd\fR and \fB\fCregistry\-host:5000/myadmin/rhel\-httpd\fR
listed.
